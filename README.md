# 👋 Hi, I’m Daniel

I’m an IT professional diving deep into Python development through the 100 Days of Code challenge. I’m especially interested in automation, scripting, and building real-world tools that solve practical problems.

Outside of tech, I’m a black belt in Brazilian Jiu Jitsu, a guitarist, and someone who finds inspiration outdoors — usually off-grid and away from screens (at least for a bit).

🧠 Always learning.  
💻 Always building.  
🥋 Always rolling.

### 🛠️ Currently working on:
- Python projects (Turtle graphics, games, automation)
- Exploring object-oriented programming
- Preparing to dive into machine learning and AI

I look at AI as a teacher at my fingertips. I don’t use it to just get answers — I use it to get unstuck, understand logic, and challenge myself with hints instead of handouts.

It’s like having a sparring partner for code: pushing me, pointing out blind spots, and helping me grow faster — without skipping the hard parts.
