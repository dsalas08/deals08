# 👋 Hi, I’m Daniel

I’m an IT professional diving deep into Python development through the 100 Days of Code challenge. I’m especially interested in automation, scripting, and building real-world tools that solve practical problems.

Outside of tech, I’m a black belt in Brazilian Jiu Jitsu, a guitarist, and someone who finds inspiration outdoors — usually off-grid and away from screens (at least for a bit).

🧠 Always learning.  
💻 Always building.  
🥋 Always rolling.

### 🛠️ Currently working on:
- Python projects (Turtle graphics, games, automation)
- Exploring object-oriented programming
- Preparing to dive into machine learning and AI

### 📫 You can follow my journey here on GitHub — and soon on LinkedIn.
